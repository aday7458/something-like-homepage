          <p>In the same times nuclear rockets were being ruled out as too grandiose, space programs were coming to a new conclusion: chemical rockets were also too expensive to keep launching, let alone a giant atomic spaceship.  But with a newfound interest in orbital industries with the satellite boom and the construction of the International Space Station, ambitious proposals were once again being floated in the field of space development.</p>
           <p>The space elevator, a cable which would stretch all the way from the earth to orbit, quickly became a well-known science fiction centerpiece. However, as something this long was seen as unrealistic to create with current materials, a more modest proposal would see light over the coming decades. If a cable can’t reach the distance to land, a fast-moving airplane might be able to cover the remaining height.</p>
           <p>The skyhook would be the imagined result of this pairing, a rotating cable which would intersect with Earth’s atmosphere. The entire assembly would vertically spin, dipping into the sky at rendezvous points where a hypersonic craft could dock with the cable. Only a third of the length required for a full space elevator would be needed — one third for the rotation downwards, one for swinging upwards, and the last made up for by delivering the payload via jet, cutting out the need for a rocket and saving massively on fuel.
           <p>Although the space elevator remains firmly planted in the realm of fiction, studies on the skyhook’s feasibility found that such a cable would not be as far off as one might think, with proof-of-concept research in 2000 devising a plan which could be constructed with modern materials. Although building it would be an undertaking many times larger than any satellite, it may not be that far away.
