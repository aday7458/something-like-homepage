          <p>When the first rockets were built, soaring upwards into the sky, humanity was gripped with the fascination of one day reaching the stars. Indeed, no one topic is more inseparable with the idea of futurism than that of the vast expanse of space. </p>
            <p>Space represents a hope for the future, one inhospitable now but a potential way out for all the troubles mankind faces now. Resources, overpopulation, the climate crisis, all would be rendered naught if humanity could leave the earth they are tied to. If only everyone could work together to reach the unknown.</p>
           <p>While compelling the minds of futurists, executing plans for space fell behind the lofty dreams they had hoped for, as the problems of Earth are ultimately more important. But regardless of their actual impact, the influence these ideas had may well be the greatest legacy of all.</p>
