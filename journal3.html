             The opening paragraph of this reading took me on a long journey about the origin of the word "bug" in programming. For a wide swath of my adolescent life, I've been under the impression that an actual insect in the works of an old computer was the reason for its modern use, but not so!
             As it turns out, it was already an established word for engineering difficulties in the 1870s, and it was used by definition in the letters of Thomas Edison in 1878.
             Mechanical problems in the World Wars were deemed bugs by slang.
             The very story of the actual bug in the computer was reported as being the "first actual bug being found" in 1945.
             This richness of information proves somewhat of a point in regards to the ubiquity of information on computer screens â€” that, and the core tenets of abstraction and repetition.
             I had read about the actual bug in a magazine at around 12-13, and I may have spread this as an unintentional piece of misinformation online. It sounds right, so it must be right.
             Now, though, I've just read that I've wrong and I accept this abstract piece of text proving me wrong with only the amount of skepticism to read another unauthored piece of text on another website to prove it.
             At some point I'm going to be reading something which wasn't even written by a man, and I'll have to see if I'm able to trust it. Maybe that's happened already.
             I have to wonder how many students here are using the generative machine to make their websites or even talk about this damn journal. I swear off the concept, but part of me is wondering. One of my classmates admits to using ChatGPT.
             Is the idea that a city is a computer not unlike the Chinese room argument? It states that regardless of if there is human inputs carrying a computer program, if they were to follow them perfectly there is no distinction from the computer itself.
             The intent of the argument is to say that no matter how human a computer may seem, it is still following its own laws. If we are all following computer-generated ideas, does that make us extensions of the computer's will?
