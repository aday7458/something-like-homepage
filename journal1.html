            I use social media as a portfolio frequently, so it feels like there is some degree of relation / disconnect between our viewpoints here.
            It's plainly difficult to drive attention to a website these days what with all of the search engine meddling going on behind the curtain.
            Recently though it feels like all the big social media sites are a crumbling set of ruins. You've got bot accounts, you've got AI scrapers, you've got some shriveled up raisin of a billionaire CEO trying to preserve his dragon hoard and milk the life out of a website.
            Hard to say if any of it is even going to be up in a few years. In that regard having a site of my own would be preferable after all.
            I don't know what metaphor I'd use for a website. Maybe they're all true.
            I feel like everything flows through the internet today. Maybe that's zoomer brainrot though.
            One of the birds said "his or her" and it made me really upset so I'm done with the first reading.

            Do you think of technology levels as chronological or dependent on the field? The blue LED wasn't made until 1993, 24 years after the moon landing.
            A number of technological advancements come earlier than you might think.
            1945 was 80 years ago. The entire second World War and all the miserable things that it progressed.
            There's a plane which has been in service for 70 years, the B-52 I believe.
            It's a long time, and I think the eras of history have been too striated in the minds of students from history classes because it's easier to divide by both time and location.
            The last Chinese emperor of the Qing dynasty abdicated in 1912, right around when Americans were colonizing the Old West.
            As for hard and soft sci-fi, surprisingly I've never heard of it being described in this way. It was always how in-detail the technology was rationalized, rather than if there was technology or not.
            In terms of a website, I feel like I've started to learn how to construct one, and that's where this connection comes in? I kind of just talked a lot unrelated to this, so my apologies.
            Then again, how to build a website would involve the server to host them, and I doubt I know how to build that...
