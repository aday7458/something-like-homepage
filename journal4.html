        <h3>On "Callum Copley - A Friend is Writing"...</h3>
        <p>
             Now that so much of our communication exists on the digital, the landscape of talking has changed.
             The amount of information which goes through the Internet completely outstrips any amount of literature which has ever existed before.
             It may be impossible for one human being to read the output of a single day of the modern world. They will read, and read, grow old, and die, and a single second of eternity will have passed.
             Our very own library of Babel.
             Anyways, there is much of those texts which exist in a bizarre paralanguage to ours, where injokes can be both within an in-group and through an entire digital generation.
             In the 2000s, everyone born in the 1990s was the ingroup. LOL. LMAO. ROFL. These have since become routine for the next generation.
             Now everyone born in the 2000s is the ingroup. Bussin. Sigma. Rizz. Based. Cringe. Skibidi.
             Everyone is writing at the same time now. A lot of people have trouble speaking over each other because they are so used to a medium where everyone has a clear delineation when someone else is writing.
             I cannot deny that I am one of these people. This has happened to me.
             This is only going to get worse with time, I fear. This is the last striation of human growth to not have a significant fraction attached to a tablet like an umbilical cord to the eyes.
             How will we be talking then? Will we need to?
