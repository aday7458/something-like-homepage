        <h3>On "Frank Chimero, The Good Room"...</h3>
        <p>
             The third place is a social theory that states that there is, and should be, a place in between your home and your work. Somewhere that you can live at your leisure. A hang out destination. A cafe. Or, indeed, a library.
             What is the third place online? Any large aggregate that exists is in the business of your time, it exists off taking up your time. That is the workspace, no?
             Curation and filtration can convert the most onerous of social media into a third space of sorts. Take out the trash of rage bait and political doomering, build up a feed of exactly one thing you want.
             Then get rid of all the ads. It's becoming increasingly difficult to do anything without an ad blocker. Then you might have something that exists outside the capitalism of time. 
             But then you still have the algorithm, which is trying to buy your time off you. Then it might be time to become a luddite.
             Like the Amish, the Luddites have a different view than what's being portrayed by the popular narrative. They weren't return to monkey caveman folks either.
             What they saw was, specifically, automation destroying workers' pay and making shoddy products. It was not the machines themselves which they hated, merely how they were used.
             Society has a knack for misinterpreting old European anti-automation mindsets. Maybe because the truth would be too revealing. Maybe so.
