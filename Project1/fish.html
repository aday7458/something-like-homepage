        <p> There's jerkwads and then there's the stonefish. Not only is it the most venomous known fish in the world, it also looks like a stone instead of the usual routine of being really bright to ward off predators. Not only that, but they can live in the sand for over a day so you aren't even safe on the beach. They are very painful. Two people have officially died from them. Just an awful awful fish.</p>

        <p> Yes, that's the name of the animal. Actually, I just picked this one for the name maybe I should not have added this fish, I don't think this is safe for work.</p>

        <p> This fish actually freaks me out, this isn't even a bit. Those green pods are actually its eyes, its, like, skull is the bottom half and that's a big dome. It's actually scary. I'm scared.</p>
