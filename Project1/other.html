    <h4> GIANT TUBE WORM </h4>

        <p>These big ol' lipsticks aren't actually worms and are more related to clams than anything. However, because science is a deliberation of what is being said the most instead of what's right, the name stuck. Despite their brilliant red color, they have never known the sun and spend their days eating bacteria in the darkest depths of the ocean.</p>

<h4> PING PONG TREE SPONGE </h4>

<p>I don't have anything big to say about this one, it's just that the name is funny enough to carry this whole thing by itself.</p>

<h4> NOT THE MEGALODON </h4>

        <div>
        <p>Listen, I know I just said only 5 to 25% of the ocean is explored but this guy is definitely dead. A shark that big that lives on the surface would be sighted by now. Giant squids get a pass because they never come to the surface alive so we didn't know about them that well. The Megalodon is extinct. Sorry.</p>
