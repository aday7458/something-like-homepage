<h4> PEACOCK MANTIS SHRIMP </h4>

<p>Look at this goofy fella. Pleasant friend good for an aquarium, right? Unfortunately not, they're ungovernable because they can smash through glass with forces that flash-evaporate the water around them into air. It accelerates about as fast as a bullet. Apparently their eyes can see polarized light, which hasn't been documented in any other animal. Good for them.</p>

<h4> BOBBIT WORM </h4>

<p>This interesting specimen can grow as long as 3 meters and has quite the snappy disposition. They hide in rocks and spring up like a slinky to get their prey. As a bristle worm, the bobbit worm supposedly has the ability to regenerate into two worms if cut in half like some kind of horror movie. Sick!</p>
