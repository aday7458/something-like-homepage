        <h1>WEIRD THINGS</h1>
        <h3>THAT LIVE IN THE OCEAN</h3>

        <p>A common factoid gets thrown around that somewhere between 5% to 25% of the ocean has been explored. That's somewhat misleading, most of it is really boring flat plains, but when you talk about how much is in the ocean it sure sounds convincing. So what actually lurks within the depths? A few weird things, actually.</p>
