             In the 2013 British TV show Utopia, a mysterious organization only called The Network plans to release a virus attacking the reproductive genes in humans.
             The birth rates of every nation affected will become almost zero.
             A randomly selected fraction will still be able to bear children, and as such their belief is that once the old generation dies off the remaining few will have the time bought to save the future of mankind.
             The ironic part of this is that it's happening already.
             To maintain a stable population, a nation must have an average birth rate of 2 per woman. In South Korea, the average is 0.75.
             The vast majority of first world nations fall below 2.0.
             This is no grand conspiracy by a network or some heavily political concept. This isn't the fall of the West or anything, it's just common sense.
             More tightly packed people and more financial strain means less births.
             So how does this connect to the Internet utopia in the same way as the reading implies?
             As more sites get packed into huge aggregate domains and it gets more expensive to host a website, the number of unique websites goes down.
             There is to that logic already a birth rate crisis for domains.
             At the same time, other parts of the world have booming birth rates, and small websites are being made everywhere as little offshoots or even whether you consider a profile page as a website.
             The solution to both cannot be from an overarching world order but an understanding of where a population is at and what they're doing. Perhaps it isn't really a problem in the larger sense at all, simply a change of demographics.
