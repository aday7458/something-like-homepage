            Well there it is, the title drop.
            If websites have gone from handmade to these mass-produced systems, I suppose you could call this next era of the Internet an industrial age of sorts.
            The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race... well, I doubt many people have read past that first line in that guy's manifesto. Not particularly relevant for this journal though, I would not recommend doing so.
            I suppose the comparison is not entirely unwarranted outside of that. Websites have become a mass-producible commodity.
            Much like the industrial age, it is necessary for the Internet to take this form for the sake of sheer volume of production.
            The desire to emulate Web 1.0 is, from a consumer's viewpoint, like organic foods or natural fibers in clothes. Do the health benefits apply? It's hard to say.
            A clunkier internet may well be healthier to consume than the algorithm-driven slop funnel which rules much of the modern Web.
